I am sitting.
I take a moment to center myself.
I sit my butt down to meditate.
I am meditating.
I meditate on the essense of being.
I sat for a while.
I sit in meditation.
I meditate.
I meditate on oneness.
I clear my mind.
I am at one with the universe.
I have a beginners mind.
I am letting it flow.
I am.
I am going with the flow.
I am staring off into space.
I am burning incense.
I am making the house smelly with incense.
When I sit, I sit as one with the universe.
During meditation, I count my breaths.
While meditating, I clear my mind.
An empty mind is the state of being for me.
Cultivate an empty mind.
Just be.
Clear your mind.
Inner Peace is achieved through meditation.
Peace of mind through clearing your mind.
Just Sit.
Expect Nothing.
Go with the flow.
Smell the incense.
Breath.
Relax.
Meditate.
Sit with purpose.
Do not think, just be.
The future is discovered with sitting.
The past is let go with sitting.
Letting go of the past is important.
Your past self does not exist.
Your future self is not determined.
A mind like water during meditation.
Meditate with a mind like water, allow the passing thoughts to flow through you.
A beginners mind is the mind to have at all times.
Stare ahead at nothing, seeing everything.
A dog is the pure essense of Zen.
Zen is nothing more than sitting.
Do not strive during meditation, just be in the present moment.
Live life in the present.
The past is a lie.
The future does not exist.
The future is unwritten.
You are not your past self.
Your future self is not your present self.
Sit without a purpose.
My butt hurts from all this sitting.
This bench hurts my butt.
Too much sitting can be bad for your butt.
To quote Buddha, Sit your motherfucking ass down, and clear your motherfucking mind.
To quote Buddha, Be Excellent To Each Other.
